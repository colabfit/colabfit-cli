# colabfit-cli
Provides a CLI for querying/downloading data present on the [ColabFit Exchange](https://colabfit.org).

Basic usage is `colabfit query <options>`. `colabfit query --help` will display all search options. 

**N.B.** It is best practice to perform an initial query without the `-d` to avoid needlessly downloading a large amount of datasets. As an alternative to bulk downloading, datasets can be downloaded individually by clicking "XYZ-link" or "LMDB-link" on the search results display.
